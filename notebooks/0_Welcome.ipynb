    "\n",
    "### [Part 1 üìö - Navigating Jupyter Notebooks](./1_Navigating_Notebooks.ipynb) (~10 mins) \n",
    "- We'll be using Jupyter Notebooks to write up our code in. We'll learn the basics of what Notebooks are and how to use them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### [Part 2 üë©‚Äçüíª - Learning the ropes of coding in R](./2_Intro_to_R.ipynb) (~15 mins)\n",
    "- In order to code up a neural network in Part 3, you'll need to have some understanding of how to write code using the programming language called R.\n",
    "- If you've coded using R or another language before fantastic, this should be a breeze for you.\n",
    "- If not, don't stress! We really only need to cover a few basic concepts to get you up and running.\n",
    "- In particular, we'll need to know about data types (integers, floats, vectors, matrices and lists), variables, and loops and functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### [Part 3 üîé - Revising the basics of neural networks](./3_Revising_NNs.ipynb) (~15 mins) \n",
    "- Revise the basics of machine learning and neural networks\n",
    "\n",
    "### [Part 4 ‚úçüèæ - Creating neural networks to classify handwritten digits](./4_Creating_NNs.ipynb) (~80 mins) \n",
    "- Using only the concepts covered in the Intro to Neural Nets presentation, and the programming concepts described in Part 2, we'll create a simple *neural network* to classify handwritten digits.\n",
    "- We'll start by revising some of the basic, key concepts described in the first seminar, before diving into implementing a network \"from scratch\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### [Part 5 üöÄ - Onwards and upwards!](./5_Onwards_and_Upwards.ipynb) (~0 mins)\n",
    "- If you're keen to learn more about neural networks and/or coding using R, we've compiled a nice set of beginner friendly resources that you might want to take a look at.\n",

    "- [x] Share with team to get thoughts\n",
    "- [x] Split part 3 into two: neural networks revision & classifing handwritten digits\n",
    "- [x] Split across separate notebooks, getting too big to all be in one\n",
    "- [x] Upload ABS logo and insert into pages\n",
    "- [x] Move to local development\n",
    "- [x] Fix titles and links\n",
    "- [x] Figure out exactly what packages we need and add them to repo (currently ggplot2 and data.table)\n",
    "- [ ] Write part 1 (1 h)\n",
    "- [ ] Polish up part 2 (1 h)\n",
    "- [ ] Write part 3 (2 h)\n",
    "- [ ] **Figure out how to make the part 4 interactive**\n",
    "- [ ] Consider get full MNIST data set or making current one smaller (decrease training time?)\n",
    "- [ ] Write instructions for options: running locally vs online (this server is not persistent)\n",
    "- [ ] Figure out best way to get data into notebook (file on GitHub, pull from somewhere else on the web, OpenML API?)\n",
    "- [ ] Contextualise use of NNs vs other methods\n",
    "- [ ] Consider other intro tutorials (is the current one really beginner friendly?)\n",
    "- [ ] Consider streaming it into two groups: no experience and experience\n",
    "- [ ] Find cool gifs and memes and other ways to make the notebooks more visually interesting\n",
    "- [ ] Polish up part 0\n"
