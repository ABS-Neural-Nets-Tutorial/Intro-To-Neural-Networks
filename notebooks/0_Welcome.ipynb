    "See below for an outline of what this session has in store.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** If you're already comfortable and familiar with notebooks and/or R, just let us know and jump ahead.\n",
    "\n",
    "### [Part 1 üìö - Exploring Jupyter Notebooks](./1_Exploring_Notebooks.ipynb) (~15 to 20 mins) \n",
    "- This session has been designed to be delivered using notebooks!\n",
    "- To follow along and get the most out of the session, it'll help to know what notebooks are, why they're cool and how you can use them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### [Part 2 üë©‚Äçüíª - Learning the ropes of coding in R](./2_Learning_R.ipynb) (~5 to 25 mins)\n",
    "- In order to understand or write the code required to create a neural network, you'll need to know some programming basics.\n",
    "- In this session, we'll be using the programming language called **R**.\n",
    "- If you've coded using R or another language before fantastic, there's nothing fancy going on here.\n",
    "- If not, don't stress! We really only need to cover a few basic concepts to get you up and running, namely about some data types (particularly matrices and lists), variables, loops and functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### [Part 3 üîé - Revising the basics of neural networks](./3_Revising_NNs.ipynb) (~15 mins) \n",
    "- We'll quickly revise some of the machine learning and neural network basics covered in the first seminar.\n",
    "\n",
    "### [Part 4 ‚úçüèæ - Creating neural networks to classify handwritten digits](./4_Creating_NNs.ipynb) (~60 mins) \n",
    "- Using *only* the concepts covered in the seminar and programming concepts covered in Part 2, we'll design and create, from the ground up, a simple **neural network** to classify handwritten digits.\n",
    "\n",
    "### [Part 5 üöÄ - Discovering more](./5_Discovering_More.ipynb) (~0 mins)\n",
    "- If you're keen to learn more about anything we covered today (including things we didn't cover but probably really should have), we've compiled a nice set of friendly resources, links and events to have a look at!\n",
